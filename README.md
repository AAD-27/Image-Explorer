# Image-Explorer

The project aims at image-to-text and text-to-speech conversion-based tools using Computer Vision and Deep Learning. The tool will help the kids learn about different pictures and objects on their own. The system will enable the children to point the camera at a specific image to convert it to text and corresponding speech. This will help the kids to understand the target image by providing its text, speech, and spelling as an output.
 
 In addition to this, it will also pop-up similar images related to the search/target picture or image object. A Deep learning-based image recognition method is used in this project. It is a new generation of enterprise search that uses artificial intelligence technologies to improve usersâ€™ search queries and extract relevant information from multiple, diverse data sets.
